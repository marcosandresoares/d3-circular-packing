<p>In order to run this page, you need to start a local server on python.</p> 
<p>The best way to start the server is by going to the terminal and type:<br/><br/>
  python -m http.server (for python 3) <br/><br/>
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer (for python 2) <br></p>
  
<p>After typing the command, the terminal should indicate which port the page can be opened.</p>
<p>Typically, you can get to the page by going to your preferred browser and typing:<br><br>
  localhost:8000 <p>
